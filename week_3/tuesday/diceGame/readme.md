# Dice Game
## Introduction
The dice game is a somewhat simple example of how to use Javascript in conjunction with CSS and HTML to create an interactive experience on the web. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use the Document Object Model to push and pull information and events to and from an HTML page into a Javascript game.

## Rules
The rules of the game are really simple. Upon loading the page, the player presses the 'Play' button to begin. Then, clicking the 'Roll' button will, you guessed it, roll the dice. The objective is to accumulate a total of 20 points by rolling the six-sided dice without rolling a 1. If you do roll a 1 you lose and will have to begin again.

## What I enjoyed about the project
I really enjoyed creating something with interactive elements, even if those interactions were very limited.
